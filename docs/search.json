    "text": "I wrote an analysis of the confessional style poem titled “Her Kind” for my American poetry class. In this paper I discuss the different rhetorical strategies that the poet Anne Sexton uses to convey the message of her poem. One of the main devices she uses is extended metaphor. She uses the extended metaphor of a witch to push a feminist and individualist theme in the poem. Sexton also uses rhyme scheme, narrative story, imagery, and alliteration among other devices to tell the story of a woman enjoying her chosen freedom.\n\n\n“Her Kind” by Anne Sexton tells the story of a woman living contently outside of society through a rigid rhyming structure coupled with a feminist theme. The poem’s more traditional aspects include alliteration, repetition of lines, and consonance. The most striking image in this poem is the extended metaphor of the witch the narrator puts into scenarios to highlight the freedom of being a different kind of woman – one who enjoys solitude. This poem follows a strict rhyme scheme and uses a witch as a feminist symbol to show readers that there is power and happiness in a woman’s individuality. \n“Her Kind” is composed of three stanzas of exactly seven lines. Each stanza in the poem follows an ABABCBC rhyming scheme, with the exception of the second stanza being ABABCAC. The second to last lines in each stanza begins with “a woman like that is.” The final line in each stanza reads the same: “I have been her kind.” The repetition of that line ties into the title of the poem. These strict, repeated structures give the poem rhythm and to reinforce the feminist theme – happiness or rejection of traditional society in solitude. This theme is emphasized with each stanza showing the “witch” in a different scene. Yet the repetition of the lines at the end of the stanzas highlights the witch is an untraditional type of woman that the narrator has been as well. \nSexton utilizes alliteration and consonance to her advantage when creating the poem’s rhythm. Some examples of alliteration are on line two reading “black air, braver” and on line nineteen “where your wheels wind.” She uses consonance to compliment the imagery of the witch’s world in the poem. A stellar example of this is in the second stanza when Sexton lists items in the witch’s cave: “skillets, carvings, shelves, closets, silks, innumerable goods.” The repetition of plural objects or “s” sounds here not only create sound in the poem but help to display an image to the reader of the witch’s dwelling. Some other examples of consonance appear on line fifteen with “your cart, driver” and line seventeen with “last bright routes.”\nThe theme of “Her Kind” is curated through Sexton’s use of imagery, symbols, and narrative story. The narrator in this poem is telling the story of a woman who lives outside of society yet is content. She introduces the symbol of a witch in the very first line of the poem to describe this woman. Sexton writes in the first person point of view to articulate that the narrator herself is like the witch. She places emphasis on this through the repeated line “I have been her kind.” Each stanza shows the reader a different vignette into this witch’s life, giving the poem a narrative structure. The second to last lines in each stanza summarizes the themes of each story within them. Her striking imagery comes within each stanza to tell the story of the witch and narrator. \nThe first stanza describes the witch’s haunting of society. Sexton writes that this narrator has “gone out, a possed witch, haunting the black air . . . dreaming evil.” These first few lines do a lot in terms of introducing the character. Sexton continues to highlight her peculiarity with images like “twelve-fingered.” Even on line six writing “a woman like that is not a woman, quite” to further underline her oddities.\nThe second stanza describes the woman’s comfort in isolation. Sexton explains how the narrator sheltered herself in a cave, yet is comfortable with all the things she collects to make it a home and how she helps others, like “the worms and the elves.” This stanza’s story is reminiscent of a traditional fairytale-like witch that readers may be familiar with. Line thirteen highlights how the woman is “misunderstood” meaning most don’t realize the beauty or happiness that this living style brings the witch.\nThe third and final stanza is an ode to the witch’s demise. Sexton alludes that the witch is being burned at the stake with vivid images like “where your flames still bite my thigh and my ribs crack where your wheels wind.” On line twenty she writes “a woman like that is not ashamed to die” which hones in the theme that despite going against conventional society, the witch was content with her life even if it leads to her death.\nThe independence of the witch and her proud rejection of traditional society lends to a feminist tone of the poem. Most of the imagery in this poem tells a story of a woman’s power. Lines like “braver at night” show the will of this woman’s actions, however, the most powerful lines here come when the narrator compares herself to this witch. This poem is purely feminist due to the theme that the witch is content living against what society tells her to do. The narrator is unashamed to say that she has “been her kind.” Poets earlier in American literature wrote in a similar style to Sexton, yet the content of their poems rarely tackled topics below the surface. Anne Sexton’s work as a whole proves that poetry can follow traditional rhyme schemes or styles yet still tackle deeper topics like feminism."

    "text": "In Cathedral Heights: A gay, Asian American man was on a walk with his parents when a white man yelled racial slurs at them and pushed his elderly parents. In Northeast: A Black transgender woman was beaten and stabbed by three people in a laundromat after being verbally assaulted with homophobic slurs. In NOMA: An Asian American jewelry store owner was attacked by a white customer in his own store resulting in 14 stitches on his face as slurs were hurled at him.\nThese are just three of the 119 hate crimes that occurred across Washington D.C. this year, which have been on the rise over the past five years, according to D.C. Police Department data. Experts attribute the rise in hate crimes in the District to increased reporting to police and polarizing political events.\nSince 2016 reported hate crimes to D.C. police increased 140% compared to the previous five year period. The most common offenses include simple assault, threats and destruction of property.\nThe majority of victims were targeted for their sexual orientation, followed closely in more recent years by victims’ ethnicity/national origin and race. Black, Jewish and Hispanic victims were the most targeted in that five year period. Hate crimes against Asian Americans doubled from 2020 to 2021.\n“In the past few years, everything that has happened in this country has combined together to make it so a place like the District, which is a huge melting pot, allows people that have hate bias motivations within them to act and for it to become a breeding ground here,” Sgt. Nicole Brown, who oversees hate crimes at that D.C. Police Department, said.\nBrown said more victims have come forward recently to report hate crimes to police than in past years, accounting for this increase. Political events and a diverse population in the District have contributed as well to the increase in hate crimes over the past five years, she said.\nIn D.C. the number of reported hate crimes decreased slightly in 2020. However, hate crimes in Maryland rose 110%, according to FBI data. Nationwide reported hate crimes reached the highest level in 12 years.\nBrown said the rise in hate crimes last year in Maryland and Virginia, yet a decrease in D.C. can be attributed to the pandemic. She said with the city’s large transient population, residents in surrounding states were not coming into the District due to business closures. So, hate crimes against minority residents were more likely to occur in their home states.\n“With COVID-19 a lot of the restaurants and bars were closed, especially in the earlier part of the year, so a lot of people were staying home in Maryland and Virginia,” Brown said. “That has a lot to do with the number shift.”\nShe said it is hard to change people’s biased and hateful views, however, by continuing to report hate crimes police can show D.C. residents they take the issue seriously. This will prevent potential perpetrators from acting on their biases if they know the serious consequences of committing a hate crime in D.C., she said. If convicted, offenders can face up to 1-and-a-half the maximum fine or prison sentence for the underlying crime. \n“The more we get out there and show we take this seriously that D.C. is a jurisdiction where if a victim perceives that they were a target of a particular crime, based on a protected trait, we check the hate crime box,” Brown said. “We want to let people know that hate crimes are serious and we do not want them here.”\nArusha Gordon, who works with hate crime victims at the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said increases in hate crimes targeting specific groups reflect political and social events. For example, the rise in crimes against Asian Americans came during the pandemic due to discourse about where the coronavirus originated. She said an increase in crimes against African Americans followed the racial justice movements in 2020, as those who are not supportive of racial justice were fueled to act.\n“Those who are most vulnerable are members of historically marginalized communities,” Gordon said. “I would flag that people who exist at the intersection of more than one, historically marginalized identity might be particularly vulnerable to hateful activity.”\nShe said in order to decrease hate crimes, communities need to address “the root of the problem.” Work needs to be done with youth to learn about biases and to increase restorative justice programs, Gordon said.\n“Rather than just locking people up who’ve engaged in hateful activity, we should really be thinking about if there is an alternative that addresses the problem?” Gordon said.\nMeredith Weisel, the deputy director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Washington D.C. office which aims to end anti-semitism and bigotry, said hate crimes have a “lasting and immeasurable impact” on the victim and their community. She said even nonviolent crimes like graffiti of a swastika, can have a large impact.\n“Behind every hate crime statistic, there’s a person, family and community who are dealing with unimaginable things as somebody was specifically targeted for a protected immutable characteristic like race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity or disability,” Weisel said.\nShe said since 2016, from “Charlottesville to Capitol Hill”, leaders have been more divisive. Leaders need to condemn acts of hate, as being polarizing will only spur people to act on their biases -- which accounts for this rise in hate crimes, Weisel said. \n“That has contributed to a climate where people feel emboldened, and energized to act [on hateful biases],” Wiesel said. “We really feel it’s so important that our leaders are condemning things like anti-semitism and hate whenever it occurs.”\nShe said the solution to decrease hate crimes is for police to prioritize reporting while gaining trust in their community to allow more victims to come forward. She said communities need to expand anti-hate education and victim services programs like restorative justice.\n“We have to ensure that combating hate crimes is a top priority,” Weisel said. “That is a form of justice.”"
